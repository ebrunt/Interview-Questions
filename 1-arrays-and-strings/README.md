1.1 - Is Unique: Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.  What if you cannot use additional data structures.

1.2 - Check permutation: Given two strings write a method to decide if one is a permutation of the other.

1.3 - URLify: Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume that the string has sufficient space at the end to hold the aditional characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.

1.4 - Palindrome Permutations: Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutatuin of a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.  A permutation is a rearrangement of letters.  The palindrome does not need to be limited to just dictionary words.

1.5 - One Away: Threre are three types of edits that can be performed on strings: insert a character, delete a character, or replace a character.  Given two strings, write a function to check if they are one edit or zero edits away.
